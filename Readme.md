# 🎯 Snake and Ladder Solver using BFS

## 📘 Project Overview
This project is a simple **AI Mini Project** that solves the classic **Snake and Ladder** game using the **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** algorithm.

It calculates the **minimum number of dice throws** required to reach the last cell from the first cell on a given board, taking into account all snakes and ladders.

## 🧠 Algorithm Used
**Breadth-First Search (BFS)** is used to explore all possible moves level by level until the destination (last cell) is reached.

Steps:
1. Represent each board cell as a node in a graph.
2. Apply BFS traversal starting from cell 1.
3. Track visited cells and count dice throws.
4. Stop when the final cell (N) is reached.
